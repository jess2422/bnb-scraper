# bnb-scraper
Scrapes AirBnB website and sorts homes by price, upon user input of location. 
- uses Selenium webdriver and phantomJS for headless browsing 
- uses lxml to parse HTML
- inspired from a solo traveler's frustration with AirBnb's lack of sorting features

Future improvements: 
- sorting by various elements 
- user-interface
- speed (current bottleneck is accomodating for headless browsing and post-JS-rendering)
